                            Providing a solution to the problem should be the ultimate goal of life.
                            The Corona Virus and the immediate lockdown that was imposed on the 22nd of March,2020 left the entire nation locked down in their respective homes. But wait !! What about the millions of homeless families out there? Did you ever give it a thought?
                            That’s what made a pathway for 2 young guys who teamed up to serve the homeless families near their locality. That indeed was a beginning of a new era which we now call the House of Humanity Charitable Trust.
                            Starting with serving food to 200 people daily amidst the lockdown the team has now grown from 2 members to around 150 members and has seen exponential growth over the past one and a half years.
                            Currently, we are working on 5 major Projects:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Hunger Eradication</li>
