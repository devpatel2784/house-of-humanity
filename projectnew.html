                giving liberates the soul of the giver.</p>

                      <h1>Project पोषण</h1>
                      <p>Many people across the globe find it difficult to feed their stomachs even one meal a day. In a world where 1/3 of the food produced goes into waste, 821 million people (that is one in nine) still do not have enough to eat. Men and women struggle to feed not only themselves, but their children as well, and thus, to help tackle the problem of hunger we will be providing healthy, fresh, and nutritious food to five hundred underprivileged people daily.

                        We, with the help of our goal to provide meals to the underprivileged, pledge to eradicate hunger and attain food security. This cannot happen overnight, but with the help of your lending hand, we can accelerate. You can donate raw materials, food-grains, and even provide monetary assistance. The result of your donations, both food, and cash, can have an immense impact on hunger.
                        
                        We provide a platform wherein you can celebrate your birthdays, marriage anniversaries, death anniversaries, or any special occasion with us. Currently, we have tie-ups with several slum areas, orphanages, handicapped schools, and old age homes wherein we provide healthy and nutritious food regularly.
                        
                        We focus to provide food that is nutrition-based where the people get the food that is common among us but unique for them.</p>

                        We conduct blood donation drives twice a year and assure that no patient faces the problem of blood shortage.       
                        In our first blood donation drive, a whopping 180 units of blood were collected in one day.</p>

                      <h2>Making menstrual hygiene accessible</h2>
                      <p>Menstrual hygiene is one of the most important yet hushed problems. Of 336 million menstruating women in India,
                     more than half of those women don’t have access to basic menstrual hygiene. Periods are a very big taboo, and not 
                     a lot many girls are educated about them reaching puberty. Because of the lack of awareness and access to proper basic
                      sanitation for women, approximately 70% of all reproductive diseases are caused by poor and negligent menstrual hygiene.
                       Many women use homemade alternatives like old cloth or hags, thus, creating a lack of quality menstrual hygiene. 
                    Our main objective is to make sanitary pads available to all the school-going girls of rural areas every month to 
                    raise awareness, improve accessibility, and availability.
                    Currently, we have tied up with 12 schools in and across Vadodara wherein we provide sanitary pads to around 1000 
                    girls free of cost every month.</p>

                       The team went for 7 days on daily visits to a different part of the city Vadodara and identified such persons and covered them with a blanket.</p>

                      <h1>Project Naari</h1>
                      <p>We need women’s empowerment more than ever. Education is very regressive in India for women.
                        One in three women is a victim of domestic violence and abuse. Women do face a lot of problems here,
                         and thus, empowering women is the need of the hour. We plan to start Gruh Udhyog wherein women who are
                          a victim of domestic violence or are widows and also women who are facing financial instabilities will
                           be provided with employment. The aim is to employ women from the vulnerable sections of society so that
                            these women become independent, strong, and capable of speaking for themselves.
                       Various training programs will be conducted to ensure proper skill development of these women so that they
                        can fend for themselves and live independent and happy life. Some of the products that will be manufactured at Gruh
                         Udhyog are paper bags, paper cups, paper glasses, and food items like achar, papad, khakhra, etc. All the profits will then go to feed the deprived people.</p>
